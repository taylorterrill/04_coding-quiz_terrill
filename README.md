# Quiz App by Taylor Terrill

University of Utah Programming Bootcamp Challenge 4

The following application is a quiz. The questions primarily involve JavaScript.

When the user clicks the start button, they will be presented with questions and a timer will begin. If the user clicks the incorrect question, they will lose time. Once the quiz is finished, the remaining amount of time will be their score. If the timer runs out before they finish the quiz, their score will be zero and the user is brought to the name entry screen. 

Currently, there are only four questions in the quiz, though more could easily be added by adding more objects to the "questions" array.
